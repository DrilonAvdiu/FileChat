# FileChat
This application is an extension of a base project called "Video Conferencing" which was built by one of the University of Cornell's students during 1999. 
The base application offered the functionality of video/audio real time playing alongside the functionality of chatting. In this very application, file transferring is an added functionality.

It is to be mentioned that the purpose of this project is a non-commercial one, as it is a project given during my university studies. 
This assignment was given under the mentorship of Professor Eliot Bytyci of University of Prishtina.

Additional information regarding the base project can be found here:

All rights reserved to the University of Cornell, or more precisely, Professor Bela Ban and Hooi Ming (which was a student back then) for building the base project.
