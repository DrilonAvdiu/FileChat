			      Todo List
			      ---------


- Configurator: check whether bottommost protocol layer implements
  LowLevelCommunication. Throw an exception if not. (Performed at the
  end of SetupProtocolStack)

- All methods in interface LowLevelCommunication except
  GetLocalAddress can be removed !

- Make Registry NOT static; there can be more than one channel in a VM !
